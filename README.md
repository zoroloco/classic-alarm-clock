Your alarm clock from the 80s.  

An alarm clock I created with the following component:

- 4 digit LED screen  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9483
- 4 push buttons
- 1000 ohm resistors for the buttons and leds
- one red led
- piezo buzzer for the alarm
- 1 arduino uno

Work in progress!  I still need to use the auto desk 123d application to create a nice sleek case to fit all the components.
